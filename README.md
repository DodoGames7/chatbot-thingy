# Chatbot-thingy
Chatbot-thingy is a Not-So-Serious project developed by me! It aims to improve the chatbot from BeingYT's one seen in Replit as well as improve it and add like certain options to it such as using embed mode for the chatbot or so. Due to it's earliness, you can only set the chatbot channel without being able to change anything else

# Backstory
Most of people on Youtube were following a tutorial on how to create a free chatbot without coding and one of it was BeingYT's video. The video was simple but however as time went on, it soon got outdated with the current aoi.js version in it and eventually the shutdown of the api used for it. The problem began when it was v5 and the invite link to aoi.js server showed up in console due to the time being not possible to disable it. This caused many people to think that it's the support server for the chatbot they have just tried it and have joined the server trying to get help but no avail. Some were being disrespectful and just didn't think much of the staff being wanting their issue to be solved as fast as possible, some have just left after failing to find a solution or for other reasons.

This issue still persists to this day and i have decided to come up with a updated version of the guy's project as i have noticed that there're bugs that makes it easy to be abused and this is how Chatbot-thingy was born. Just a simple chatbot with nothing fancy about it tho.
